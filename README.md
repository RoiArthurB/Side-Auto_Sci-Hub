## Background

I was tired to copy the URL of pages to paste it in [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) website 100 times per hours while I was reading scientific papers. 

So I've created a very simple button addon for [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) which do it all for me.

### Context Menu

If you right click on a link, you'll see in the contextual menu a line to open to location of that link in sci-hub.

It's also possible to do the same by right clicking anywhere on the webpage. In that case it will open the current web page on sci-hub.

<!-- A huge thanks to @Jackymancs4 for that awesome work ! :D -->

### Options

Also, from the version 2.0, you're now free to choose your how redirection. That way you're able to use a raw IP address, your own instance of [WhereIsSciHub](https://gitlab.com/Flockademic/whereisscihub), or whatever you want üòÄ

## Built With
* [Where Is Sci-Hub Now ?](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) - List several alternative working links to active Sci-Hub mirrors

> FYI - The plugin currently use a fork fixed of the official WhereIsSciHub, _Vinni_ (the author of that tool) can't update his version now so I'm using [a fork](https://gitlab.com/Flockademic/whereisscihub/-/merge_requests/4) to have a working plugin ! :D

## Acknowledgments

PS: If the plugin is not available on markets anymore, it must be due to the fact that it doesn't respect Market Policy, so build it from source (it's a very simple plugin based on JS API, so it should work on any browser version) and enjoy the plugin ! üòÄüòÄ
