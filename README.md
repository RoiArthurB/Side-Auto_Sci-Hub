Elsevier provides , among other things, the ScienceDirect platform, through which it distributes scientific journal articles in which it holds the copyright. In order to protect its copyright interest in those articles, Elsevier brought a civil action against a number of websites commonly known as "Sci-Hub" and "LibGen" or "Library Genesis" and their respective mirrors which engage in the large-scale infringement of those copyrights. On June 21, 2017, Elsevier obtained a judgement against those websites which, among other things, enjoined the websites, their operators, and anyone acting in concert with them, from infringing Elsevier' s copyrighted works or assisting others in doing so.

> I'll try to quickly work to have a auto-upgrade/install process with Github packages, stay tune 😉

## Background

I was tired to copy the URL of pages to paste it in [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) website 100 times per hours while I was reading scientific papers. 

So I've created a very simple button addon for [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) which do it all for me.

## Installing

This part will explain you how to load the plugin in developper mode. I would recommand you to prefer installing the plugin from the official stores (with links above).

### Firefox

<!-- https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/23/loading-temporary-add-ons/ -->

Open the debug page on the addon section

```
about:debugging#addons
``` 

> Depending on your version of Firefox, this link may redirect you somewhere else. e.g. Ff 71 => `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`

From that webpage, press the bug button **Load Temporary Addon-On...** and choose the _manifest.json_.

### Chrome/Chromium

IDK the way to, but the plugin is working on it (because it's using the very raw functions of any browser If you want to complete that part, feel free to PR it /2020😉

Also, as written above, the plugin is not (and will never be) on the chrome store because it doesn't respect [it's policy](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/program_policies#content_policies)

> Prohibited Products:
>
>   We don't allow products or services that:
>
>    * __Facilitate unauthorized access to content on websites, such as circumventing paywalls or login restrictions__
>    * Encourage, facilitate, or enable the unauthorized access, download, or streaming of copyrighted content or media
>    * Mine cryptocurrency

## How to use

### Firefox addon button

Go on scientific page with PDF hidden behind a paywall, click on the _Auto Sci-Hub_ button, and Sci-Hub will pop up with your PDF on another tab 😀

### Context Menu

If you right clic on a link, you'll see in the contextual menu a line to open to location of that link in sci-hub.

It's also possible to do the same by right clicking anywhere on the webpage. In that case it will open the current web page on sci-hub.

<!-- A huge thanks to @Jackymancs4 for that awesome work ! :D -->

### Options

Also, from the version 2.0, you're now free to choose your how redirection. That way you're able to use a raw IP address, your own instance of [WhereIsSciHub](https://gitlab.com/Flockademic/whereisscihub), or whatever you want 😀

## Built With
* [Where Is Sci-Hub Now ?](https://whereisscihub.now.sh/) - List several alternative working links to active Sci-Hub mirrors

> FYI - The plugin currently use a fork fixed of the official WhereIsSciHub, _Vinni_ (the author of that tool) can't update his version now so I'm using [a fork](https://gitlab.com/Flockademic/whereisscihub/-/merge_requests/4) to have a working plugin ! :D

## Acknowledgments

PS: If the plugin is not available on markets anymore, it must be due to the fact that it doesn't respect Market Policy, so build it from source (it's a very simple plugin based on JS API, so it should work on any browser version) and enjoy the plugin ! 😀😀

PPS: If you love Sci-Hub too, support the project by sending a contribution to the Sci-Hub Bitcoin address: ***1K4t2vSBSS2xFjZ6PofYnbgZewjeqbG1TM***

PPPS: If it's too complicated to install the plugin on Chrome/ium, consider switching to Firefox 🦊
