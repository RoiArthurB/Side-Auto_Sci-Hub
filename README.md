## Background

I was tired to copy the URL of pages to paste it in [Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) website 100 times per hours when I was reading scientific papers. 

So I've created a very simple button addon for [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) which do it all for me.

## How to use

Go on scientific page with PDF hidden behind a paywall, click on the _Auto Sci-Hub_ button, and Sci-Hub will pop up with your PDF on another tab 😀

PS: I'm not using Chrome nor Chromium, and I'm too lazy to take a look on development for that software... So consider switching to Firefox 🦊

PPS: If you're not as lazy as I am, feel free to send it to me in a pull request ^^
